        I was listening to the ocean
        I saw a face in the sand
        But when I picked it up
        Then it vanished away from my hands, down
        I had a dream I was seven
        Climbing my way in a tree
        I saw a piece of heaven
        Waiting, impatient, for me, down
        And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?
        Nobody knows, nobody knows
        I was dancing in the rain
        I felt alive and I can't complain
        But now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I can't take it anymore
        I was painting a picture
        The picture was a painting of you
        And for a moment I thought you were here
        But then again, it wasn't true, down
        And all this time I have been lying
        Oh, lying in secret to myself
        I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf
        And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?
        Nobody knows, nobody knows
        And I was dancing in the rain
        I felt alive and I can't complain
        But now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I got no other place to go
        Now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I got no other place to go
        Now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I can't take it anymore
        But I kept running for a soft place to fall
        And I kept running for a soft place to fall
        And I kept running for a soft place to fall
        And I kept running for a soft place to fall
        And I was running far away
        Would I run off the world someday?
        But now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I got no other place to go
        Now take me home
        Take me home where I belong
        I got no other place to go
        Now take me home, home where I belong
        Now take me home, home where I belong
        Now take me home, home where I belong
        Now take me home, home where I belong
        I can't take it anymore</pre>
